# Machine Learning 

This course is an introduction to machine learning concepts, techniques, and algorithms. Topics include regression, statistical and probabilistic methods, parametric and non-parametric methods, classification, clustering, and neural networks. This course will cover both foundational and practical aspects by (1) discussing the motivations behind popular machine learning algorithms; (2) developing a mathematical foundation for the methods of machine learning; (3) writing programs in Python for implementing machine learning algorithms; and (4) evaluating the designed systems to determine whether they work well for a particular task.
